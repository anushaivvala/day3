Question:Difference between window,screen and documentation
                             WINDOW OBJECTS:
window object represents the current browsing context.
It holds things like window.location,window.history,window.screen,window.status,window.document.
Each browser tab has its own top-level window object.
The window object is supported by all browsers.
 The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser .
                             SCREEN OBJECTS:
 Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.
 It can be used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc.
 It is not mandatory to write window prefix with screen object.    
  It can be written without window prefix.
                              DOCUMENT OBJECTS
  The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree. 
 When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object.
  The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc. G
